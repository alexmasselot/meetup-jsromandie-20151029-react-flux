# meetup-jsromandie-20151029-react: react dummy app with flux

## Install

Clone the project then

    npm install
    npm install -g gulp

## Run

The generated project includes a live-reloading static server on port `9002` (you can change the port in the `gulpfile.js` config),
which will build, launch, and rebuild the app whenever you change application code.
To start the server, run:

```bash
$ npm start
```

If you prefer to just build without the live reload and build-on-each-change watcher, run:

```bash
$ npm run build
```
